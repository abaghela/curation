# curation
The goal of **curation** is to provide a Shiny app to access manually-curated 
molecular data on sepsis from current publications.


## Usage & availability
Currently, the app is not hosted any any website or service. If you wish to try
it out, you can download this repository and run it locally. The following R
packages are required to run the app:

- [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)
- [ShinyJS](https://deanattali.com/shinyjs/)
- [DT](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/)
- [The tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/r/)

The data for the app is currently only available to contributors and curators,
outside of this repository.
